# Terminal Commands
### Breakdown
This repository is home of a few commands I decided were worthwhile 
to have a dedicated terminal command for. The processes are python 
scripts contained directly in this directory. 

## Installation

1. Clone or fork this repository and store it somewhere on your device. 
2. Insert `source the/path/to/export.sh` into your `.bashrc`
3. Reopen your terminals

## Future Plans

- Allow implementation of more complex commands that require their own folder
